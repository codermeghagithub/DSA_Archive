### Two Pointers in Java

The two-pointer technique in Java is a powerful algorithmic approach used to efficiently solve problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists by utilizing two indices (pointers) that traverse the data structure in a specific manner.
 These pointers typically start from different positions—often from the beginning and end of a sorted array—and move towards each other based on the problem's conditions, such as comparing values or searching for a target sum.
